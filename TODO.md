# TODOS

- [ ] Change FFT `data` variable to hold fft vals instead of time domain vals. 
    - [ ] Make FFT class `convolvable`  

- [ ] Make new convolution strategy to replace Brute Force (BF) strategy
- [ ] Add Gaussian distribution generator
- [ ] Add White noise generator
- [ ] Add `analytic signal` function 
    - [ ] In where? Used for bandpass signals
- [ ] Implement Analog signal, allow custom sampling rate, include nyquist freq (based on freq or bandwidth)
- [ ] Look at using rubyvis as graphical tool instead of gruff
