# Digiproc

Use Digiproc to perform a number of digital signal processing calculations. Easily represent digital and analog signals, find their Discrete Fourier Transform in O(n*lgn) time, and create various systems from filtering, modulation, encoding, etc. Digiproc also enables you to easily solve a wide range of probability and linear algebra-based problems. 

Easily visualize data in a graphing API built on top of gruff.

See the `examples` folder as well as the `spec`s. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'digiproc'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install digiproc

If you are having trouble downloading the rmagick gem on OSX, try the following:

```
    brew uninstall imagemagick
    brew install imagemagick@6
    export PATH="/usr/local/opt/imagemagick@6/bin:$PATH"
    brew link --force imagemagick@6
    gem install rmagick
```

## Usage

Graphing capabillity built on top of [gruff](https://github.com/topfunky/gruff) gem, which uses the [rMagick](https://rubygems.org/gems/rmagick/versions/2.15.4) gem and ImageMagick. 

__Look at specs and the `examples` folder for examples on how to use these classes in calculations__

__Limitations to be aware of__:
 - All signals must be causual -> negative values of n are not supported
 - The FFT, as of now, uses a Radix 2 algorithm. So, the overall size must be a power of 2 - any dataset is zero-filled automatically to meet this necessity. This gives you less control over the exact size if needed and may cause slower runtimes (however the radix 2 algorithm is &#1012;(nlgn)). This zero-fill _will_ increase the resolution of the FFT output, however.
 - All filter data and windows must have an even number of datapoints. If not, this will be done automatically. This is to facilitate the ability to create any type of filter using the windowing method. (Odd numbers of values can preclude certain types of filters)
 - All filters are FIR and are implemented via the windowing method. Although you can get pretty good results depending on your application, this is an older method compared to the optimal Parks-McClellan algorithm.
 - IIR Filter design is not included
 - The quantization process in Digiproc::AnalogSignal maps an analog signal to -1 to 1 before quantizing the result. A floating point number is accurate up to 7 decimal places, so this process will cause unwanted ACTUAL quantization errors (not simulated quantization errors) for an amplitude range greater than $2 x 10^16$ (ie 20 Quadrillion)

This is still a work in progress. There are many usuable functions, and many that still require tuning. Functions tested in the `spec` file are very reliable.



__Run Examples__

Use ```rake examples:run[file]``` to run an example file to see how it works, ie: ```rake examples:run[binomial_distribution/dice]```


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/micahshute/digiproc. 

There is a long list of intended actions in the `TODO.md` file. Tests (rspec) covers many core capabilities, but more need to be written to cover the entire gem.

This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct. That being said, negative feedback is always welcome.
